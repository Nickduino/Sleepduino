Sleepduino
==========

Open sleepduino.ino and the sleep.ino tab will automatically be included
by the Arduino IDE as long as you place it in the same folder.

The example function is the void flash(). You can modify it to perform whatever task you need your Arduino to to. You can also modify the CYCLES parameter to changer the number of 8 second long naps your Arduino will do before accomplishing said tasks.
